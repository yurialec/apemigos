# Generic System

## Overview

The **Generic System** is designed to provide a flexible access level management system coupled with a landing page administration tool. This project includes a variety of functionalities, including a comprehensive CRUD system for managing users.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Create roles and assign specific permissions to each role. Users associated with a role will only have access to the permissions granted to that role, ensuring a secure and organized access management system.
  
- **Landing Page Management:** A dedicated module named "Site" allows users to easily edit the landing page. Users can modify key elements such as the main text, logo, footer, and more, ensuring the page is always up-to-date and aligned with your brand.
